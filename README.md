## Example integration for Home Assistant

I'm trying to learn Python by creating a custom integration for Home Assistant.

Currently this basic example will create a "Hello World Sensor" using config flow.


#### Install with HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)

You can install this example integration using [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs#hacs-home-assistant-community-store)

In HACS Settings --> Custom Repositories, add the following:
```

Use type: `Integration`
